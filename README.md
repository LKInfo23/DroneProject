# DroneProject

This repository is a project to help students to intuitively understand vectors through a hands on approach. A DJI Tello Ryze will be controlled using an android app to visualize simple vectors and the solution to vector related problems like:

- Vector addition/subtraction
- Linear functions
- Calculating vector magnitude

Teachers will get user accounts where they can set up classes and control over who gets to join by class codes.
Students can use the code to join a class where they will be able to set their name and start a lesson. After connecting to Wifi the amount of right and wrong answers will be uploaded for the teachers to see.
