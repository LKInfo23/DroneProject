# DroneProject

This repository is a project aiming to visualize simple vectors operations using a drone. It helps students get a more intuitive first understanding of vectors through a hands on approach using a DJI Tello Ryze drone, which will be controlled via an android app.

The app will allow students to solve procedurally generated problems of the categories:
- Vector addition/subtraction
- Linear functions
- Calculating vector magnitude

Teachers will get user accounts where they can set up classes and control over who gets to join by class codes.
Students can use the code to join a class where they will be able to set their name and start a lesson. After connecting to Wifi the amount of right and wrong answers will be uploaded for the teachers to see.
