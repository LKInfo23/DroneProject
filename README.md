# DroneProject

This repository is a project aiming to visualize simple vectors operations using a drone. It helps students get a more intuitive first understanding of vectors through a hands on approach using a DJI Tello Ryze drone, which will be controlled via an android app.

The app will allow students to solve procedurally generated problems of the categories:
- Vector addition/subtraction
- Linear functions
- Calculating vector magnitude
